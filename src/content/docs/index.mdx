## Why Procwire Transport?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Zero Dependencies" icon="puzzle">
    The core `@procwire/transport` package has **zero runtime dependencies**. No bloat, no conflicts, just pure TypeScript.
  </Card>

<Card title="Modular Architecture" icon="setting">
  Mix and match transport layers, framing strategies, serialization codecs, and protocols. Use what
  you need, nothing more.
</Card>

<Card title="Type-Safe" icon="approve-check">
  Full TypeScript support with generics throughout. Catch errors at compile-time, not runtime.
</Card>

<Card title="High Performance" icon="rocket">
  Choose your performance trade-offs: JSON for simplicity, MessagePack for speed, Protobuf for
  schemas, Arrow for analytics.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-Platform" icon="laptop">
  Automatic platform detection. Named Pipes on Windows, Unix Domain Sockets on Linux/macOS. One API,
  all platforms.
</Card>

<Card title="Production Ready" icon="star">
    Used in real-world applications. Comprehensive test suite, detailed documentation, and active maintenance.
</Card>

## Flexible & Modular

Build your perfect IPC stack in seconds. The API is designed to be fluent and readable.

```typescript
import { ChannelBuilder } from "@procwire/transport/channel";
import { MessagePackCodec } from "@procwire/codec-msgpack";
import { LengthPrefixedFraming } from "@procwire/transport/framing";
import { JsonRpcProtocol } from "@procwire/transport/protocol";

// Create a highly optimized binary channel
const channel = new ChannelBuilder()
  .withTransport(myTransport)
  .withFraming(new LengthPrefixedFraming())
  .withSerialization(new MessagePackCodec())
  .withProtocol(new JsonRpcProtocol())
  .withTimeout(5000)
  .build();
```
