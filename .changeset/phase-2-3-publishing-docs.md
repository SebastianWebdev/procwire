Publishing hygiene and documentation accuracy:

- **LICENSE is now actually included in every published tarball.** The `files` entry pointed at a LICENSE file that did not exist in the package directories, so npm silently dropped it. A new CI check (`scripts/check-publish-artifacts.mjs`) verifies tarball contents (LICENSE, README, dist entrypoints) for all publishable packages.
- **Internal dependency ranges publish as caret ranges.** `workspace:*` rewrites to an exact version pin on publish, which causes needless peer/dedup conflicts for consumers; `workspace:^` keeps published ranges caret-compatible. Enforced by the same CI check.
- **`@procwire/codecs` no longer declares an unused peer dependency on `@procwire/protocol`** - the codec interfaces are structurally typed and never import it, so consumers were forced to install protocol for nothing.
- READMEs now document the v1.2 behavior: the 30s default request timeout (`requestTimeout()`), the `spawnPolicy.heartbeat` liveness option, graceful `$shutdown`, and automatic child shutdown on stdin EOF (parent death). The Bun package READMEs state explicitly that typed schema generics are currently Node-only.
- The "zero runtime dependencies" claim is now scoped truthfully to `@procwire/protocol` (core/client depend on `@procwire/codecs`, which ships MessagePack and Arrow).
- Stale source comments fixed: the ~2GB cap in `wire-format.ts` is a deliberate conservative limit (not a Node Buffer limitation on Node >= 22), and the msgpack Buffer ext encoder no longer claims to be zero-copy (it copies on encode).
