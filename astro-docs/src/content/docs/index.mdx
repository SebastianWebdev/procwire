## Why Procwire?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Binary Data Plane" icon="rocket">
    New in v2.0: Binary wire protocol with 11-byte header for data plane. **Target: >1 GB/s throughput** for large payloads.
  </Card>

<Card title="Dual-Channel Architecture" icon="setting">
  Control plane (stdio, JSON-RPC) for lifecycle management. Data plane (pipe, binary) for
  high-throughput user data.
</Card>

<Card title="Type-Safe" icon="approve-check">
  Full TypeScript support with builder pattern and generics. Schema-first design where parent
  defines the contract.
</Card>

<Card title="Zero Dependencies" icon="puzzle">
  Core packages have zero runtime dependencies. Optional codec packages for MessagePack, Arrow, and
  more.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-Platform" icon="laptop">
  Named Pipes on Windows, Unix Domain Sockets on Linux/macOS. One API, all platforms.
</Card>

  <Card title="In Development" icon="star">
    v2.0 is under active development. New binary protocol replaces JSON-RPC on data plane for 80x performance improvement.

## What's New in v2.0

Procwire v2.0 introduces a fundamental architecture change:

| Channel       | v1.x     | v2.0       | Impact                |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Control Plane | JSON-RPC | JSON-RPC   | No change             |
| Data Plane    | JSON-RPC | **Binary** | ~30 MB/s -> ~2.5 GB/s |

### Why the Change?

JSON-RPC on the data channel caused severe performance issues:

- **5x larger payload** (JSON text vs binary)
- **~500ms serialization overhead** per 1MB of data

The new binary wire format eliminates this overhead completely.

```
Binary Frame (Data Plane):
+----------+-------+----------+----------+----------------------+
| Method ID| Flags | Req ID   | Length   | Payload              |
| 2 bytes  | 1 byte| 4 bytes  | 4 bytes  | N bytes              |
+----------+-------+----------+----------+----------------------+
```
